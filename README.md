## Repo containing dataset, documents and R script devoped during the final Course Project
During this project, I did make the below activities:
1. download the zip file from the indicated URL
2. unzip the file
3. create the working directory G:/Anno 2017/Johns_Hopkins_Data_Science/3. Getting and Cleaning Data/Week 4/Course Project"
4. develop the R script run_analysis, which make the below actions:
  4.1. Load the activity and feature info.
  4.2. Load training and test datasets, keeping only columns anout mean or standard deviation.
  4.3. Load activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
  4.4. Merge the two datasets
  4.5. Convert activity and subject columns into factors
  4.6. Create a tidy data table, by melting and casting previous data table, consisting of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject/activity pair
  5.7. Create a tidy dataset, by the name of "tidy_dataset.txt", from the previous tidy data table
